				<h4>
					Tired of going down the deep underground dungeon of the sites that 
					promise good, free stock photos?

				<p>
					Everybody has searched for that elusive stock photo, especially for open
					source projects.  After all, hours of work is being provided for the 
					betterment of the whole development community, why not stock photos?
				</p>

				<p>
					The problem with free stock photos is that they are either low-res 
					amateur photos, cheesy photos of people wearing headsets, or bait-and-switch
					type operators where they either spam you with incessant emails, or you 
					don't truly get value.
				</p>

				<p>
					Nevertheless below is an ongoing list of the best stock photo sites that 
					we, at synapticloop, have actually used.  <em>The photos on these github 
					pages are sourced from them</em>.
